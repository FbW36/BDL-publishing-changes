# Clone, Pull, Push

**Instructions**
* Work together with a partner. 
* Create one repository on github.
* You should both clone the repository. 
* One person should make changes on the repository e.g. add a readme file and add text. Push these changes.
* The other person should pull the changes locally. Make more changes and push until you both have the same text in the readme file locally.
